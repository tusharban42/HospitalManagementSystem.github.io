Problem Statement - The problem is : queuing at hospital is often managed manually by administrative staff , then take a token there and then wait for our turn then ask for the doctor and the most frustrating thing - we went there by travelling a long distance and then we come to know the doctor is on leave or the doctor can't take appointments.
Solution - Patients can book their appointments at home , they can check whether the doctor is available or not.
